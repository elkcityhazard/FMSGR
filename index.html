                                We at Family Medicine Specialists believe in promoting the health of all persons. At
                                this time, facial masks and social distancing are the only tools we have against
                                COVID-19. While there are a lot of things being investigated, there is no treatment, no
                                cure and no vaccine against this new coronavirus. As such, we are supporting the mask
                                mandate by the State of Michigan and requiring face masks be worn at all times while
                                inside our office. As a practice, we will also NOT be writing any letters for patients
                                stating they do not need to wear a mask.
                                if you do not want to wear a mask and still need to see or talk to your provider, we do
                                have telehealth options available.

                            <p>We are here to take care of you during these turbulent times. By now, you have been
                                barraged with information on the coronavirus. We will assist patients in triaging
                                symptoms during this time. In short, though, know that the covid-19 coronavirus is
                                characterized by a dry cough, fever, shortness of breath and fatigue. Other viral
                                illness such as the common cold and influenza are characterized by fever, cough, runny
                                nose, body aches, headache and fatigue. If you come into the office with concerning
                                symptoms, you may be asked to wait in your car until a room is ready.
                                While face-to-face visits are more meaningful, in these times the use of technology to
                                bridge barriers and ensure safety may be the best option. We encourage you to sign up
                                for our telehealth platform using the following step-by-step process. Now is the time to
                                sign up as opposed to when urgent care is needed. Your doctors at FMS will be available
                                to see you on telehealth when you need it. Note that you will need a smartphone for this
                                application and not a PC or laptop. <strong>We will be billing your insurance company
                                    for your telehealth visit, if you have any concern please let the provider
                                    know.</strong>

                                In this time, please remain calm and use common sense measures. While your children are
                                home from school do not have grandparents watch them. This illness is potentially deadly
                                for our elders and more benign for our youth. Please take this point seriously. Social
                                distancing is scientifically proven to save lives. Please practice this and avoid public
                                gatherings until it is again safe. Though you may be at low risk please think of the
                                potential spread to our older population. Wash your hands frequently.
                                Please be patient with our office as we may be overwhelmed during this pandemic

                                At Family Medicine Specialists we strive to meet your individual and unique healthcare
                                needs. Our team is made up of doctors, physician assistants/nurse practitioners, nurses,
                                medical assistants and administrative personnel who work for you.
                                We embrace the Patient-Centered Medical Home model of care. By this, we see our medical
                                practice as a place where health needs are met primarily and in a way that patients are
                                well-known, providing care from different sources and at different levels. Recognizing
                                that there are times when more specialized health care is needed, we pride ourselves on
                                working closely with and referring to the best specialty care available.
                                Here at FMS we value the principals of communication, service and availability as
                                pillars in the care that we provide. Thank you for letting us provide the primary
                                medical care for you and your family.
